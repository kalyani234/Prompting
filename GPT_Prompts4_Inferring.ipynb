        "\"It's going to look different because it didn't come from our solar system and that's what makes it so magical.\"\n",
        "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n",
        "Ever since the famous \"interstellar invader\" comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in our solar system earlier this year, scientists have been enamored with its existence and the serendipity that brought it here — including experts at NASA. As such, the agency has been working to point several of its spaceborne instruments at the peculiar subject, which, incredibly, is only the third interstellar object on record to enter our corner of the cosmos.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indeed, on Wednesday (Nov. 19), NASA released brand-new images of comet 3I/ATLAS collected by quite a few spacecraft — including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Perseverance Mars rover and the Lucy asteroid-studying probe, to name a few. In total, an impressive 15 different agency space missions are confirmed to have their eyes peeled for new data about the interstellar visitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We've even pushed our scientific instruments beyond their normal capabilities, beyond the things that they were designed to achieve, to allow us to capture this amazing glimpse at this interstellar traveler,\" Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said during a press briefing on Wednesday.\n",
        "Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is seen as a faint smudge against a background starfield in two images taken by the Mastcam-Z instrument aboard NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover on Oct. 4, 2025. At the time it was imaged, the comet was about 18.6 million miles (29.9 million kilometers) from the rover, which was exploring the rim of the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS)\n",
        "The new images, which we'll discuss below, add to a growing set of footage we have of the object. For instance, we already have some striking stills, such as this composite showing it blasting a jet toward the sun, and this image capturing its growing tail.And, first and foremost, NASA officials confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is actually a comet. In other words, no, it is not an alien spaceship, as many rumors across the internet suggest.\n",
        "It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet. But this one came from outside the solar system, which makes it fascinating, exciting and scientifically very important,\" NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya said during the press briefing.\n",
        "You kind of know the signatures that you're looking for; we were quick to be able to say, 'Yep, it definitely behaves like a comet,'\" Fox said. \"We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.\"\n",
