The story describes about the Wall - E a robot left alone on Earth to clean garbarges after human and found Eva. I like the thought WALL-E was a groundbreaking film with amazing plot and characters. Not only does the film explore themes of anti-capitalism and global warming, it also manages to get the audience to connect very deeply with non-human, robotic main characters. The main storyline of the film follows a robot named WALL-E who appears to be (along with his pet cockroach) one of the last “living” beings on Earth. Prior to the start of the film, a single corporation ran society and, as you’d expect, this resulted in earth being overrun with trash while the environment became increasingly unlivable. As a result, a group of people (still lead by this same corporation) rebuilt a home in space and have continued to live there for hundreds of years. Left behind, WALL-E is living a lonely secluded life when a robot named EVE suddenly lands nearby with the goal of determining whether or not the atmosphere is viable for the humans to return. The rest of the movie follows WALL-E as he becomes smitten with EVE and naively follows her back to the human-inhabited space station.\n",

        "The battery life is incredible. It came with 63% charge. I turned them on and within seconds they were connected to my phone. I charged them to 100% and the battery level has hardly moved! The headphones also come with a decent bag/case to keep them in and inside the case you will get the USB-C to USB-C charging cable, and a standard headphone jack cable all neatly stored away.\n",

From the moment you unbox it you just feel like you have something special. It was surprisingly heavy for being so slim . Passed the one finger open test and just turned on when I opened the lid. Set up was a shock. I had my ipad next to me and it asked if I wanted to set up using the ipad. Confused I hit yes and then like magic it was set up. It wasn't even connected to WiFi yet but with a press on the ipad the laptop was connected, passwords ported over and ready to go. Coming from the painful set up on windows this was like witchcraft. The display is just stunning. Crisp and the colours are incredible. Then the speakers. How can they fit that sound into something so slim? Oh and the laptop is totally silent. I'm used to a jet engine on any laptop after a few mins.\n",

We then move back in time to 1921 where Opaline Carlisle shares the story of her love of books and how following the death of her father, her brother had sought to marry her off. She runs away from home and finds her way to Paris. There she works in a bookshop and begins a fledgling career as a book dealer.\n",
        "\n",

        "The third narrative voice is Henry Field, a British academic in search of a lost manuscript. His only clue to its whereabouts is a letter from one of the world’s most successful rare book dealers to Miss Opaline Gray, a bookshop owner in Ha'penny Lane, Dublin.\n",
        "\n",
        "The evening he arrives in Dublin Henry has an unusual experience when he is dropped off in Ha'penny Lane. He enters the bookshop then suddenly finds himself back outside. Too many G&Ts on the flight? In the light of day he discovers that the bookshop’s address is waste ground. It is located next door to Mrs. Bowen’s and he soon meets Martha, who at first believes him to be a Peeping Tom! I won’t say more to avoid spoilers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chapters cycle between the three main characters and between the past and present. It becomes obvious that there is something strange about the bookshop, including other reports of people walking into it but it then disappearing. Then there are the tree roots seemingly growing from the ceiling of Martha’s room and the tattoo on her back that has begun changing on its own.\n",
        "\n",
        "I appreciated the aspects of magical realism found throughout the novel. It can be a delicate balance to integrate these elements without entering into full-on fantasy fiction. I felt that Evie Woods succeeded in creating a subtle sense of wonder.\n",

        "With respect to the audiobook, I was glad that there were three readers, each narrating one of the main characters. While this was my first experience of all three, I felt that they did well including with the various characters’ accents.\n",
